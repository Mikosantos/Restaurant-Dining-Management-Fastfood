## Overview
This repository documents the development process of the <b>Restaurant Dining Management Fastfood</b> database application which is a requirements for the <b>CCINFOM</b> course, "Introduction to Information Management" at De La Salle University. The project began with the conceptualization of core data and field requirements, followed by the modeling of the database using the <i>Entity-Relationship-Table</i> (ERT) model. The ERT model is detailed in [ERT_Model_FastfoodDiningManagement](https://github.com/Mikosantos/Restaurant-Dining-Management-Fastfood/files/13714583/ERT_Model_FastfoodDiningManagement.pdf) (in pdf form) or [ERT_Model_FastfoodDiningManagement](https://github.com/Mikosantos/Restaurant-Dining-Management-Fastfood/blob/main/DB_DESIGN_APP.mwb) (in mwb form).

## Database Initialization
The database was implemented according to the ERT model, and records were populated using an Excel sheet, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Mikosantos/Restaurant-Dining-Management-Fastfood/blob/main/Fastfood_Records.xlsx). The database schema is defined in the SQL script available [here](https://github.com/Mikosantos/Restaurant-Dining-Management-Fastfood/blob/main/GROUP3-DBAPPSCRIPT.sql).

## Application Development
The database application was coded to handle various core data elements, transactions, and reports. Refer to the project proposal for a detailed structure of the database application. The proposal document is available [here](https://github.com/Mikosantos/Restaurant-Dining-Management-Fastfood/tree/main/files).
